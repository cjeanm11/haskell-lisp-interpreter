## Functional programming exploration

#### This repository contains the code and documentation for an academic assignement at the University of Montreal. 

#### Lisp-Like Language Implementation

This codebase implements a Lisp-like language, focusing on lexical and syntax analysis, evaluation, and pretty printing.

#### Key Components:

- Library Imports: Uses libraries for syntax parsing and IO handling.

- Data Structures: Defines internal representations like lists, symbols, numbers, and functions.

- Pretty Printer: Implements a function to display S-expressions in a readable format.

- Lexical Analyzer: Handles the parsing of characters, comments, and symbols.

- Syntax Analyzer: Analyzes the structure of S-expressions.

- Evaluator: Includes a partially completed evaluator for executing the language expressions.
